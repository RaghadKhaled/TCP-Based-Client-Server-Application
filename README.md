# TCP-Based-Client-Server-Application

--- 

This is a project required for a Computer Networks course during my BSc studies.<br>
It is done as teamwork with my colleagues.

## Project overview

In this project, we developed a simple TCP-based client-server application that exchanges messages between device-to-device, client-to-server, and vice versa using socket programming with Python language. <br>
Where we implemented two modes of exchanging the messages, the open mode, where the client sends and receives the data as cleartext, and the secure mode, where our TCP tunnel is protected using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm to protect the traffic in the transit path.
